<h1> <b> RECALLED HAPPINESS: A EUPHORIC AND NOSTALGIC JOURNEY TO REMEMBER </b></h1>
<p> As the academic year comes to an end, the Class of 2023–2024 graduates are experiencing a flood of mixed emotions, 
    including nostalgia and excitement. When they think back on the four years that have passed, memories flash through
    their heads like a compilation of special occasions. Every experience, from the anxious anticipation of orientation 
    day to the exuberant celebrations of sporting triumphs, is ingrained in the collective mind of the graduating class.
    The friendship created via group projects, late-night study sessions propelled by coffee, and breaks filled with 
    laughter that reverberate through the hallways are all integral parts of their shared experiences. But there were 
    also difficult and challenging times amid the jokes and friendship. The sleepless nights spent studying for tests, 
    the pressure of impending deadlines, and the sporadic failures that tried their fortitude have all aided in their 
    personal development. Nevertheless, the graduating class is more resilient and stronger than before, despite all of
    the difficulties. They are both excited and nervous as they stand on the brink of a new chapter in their lives. For
    some, it's the chance to pursue a career path they've always desired. For others, it represents the chance to pursue
    new interests or intellectual endeavors. A tangible sense of appreciation and pride permeates the air as they get ready 
    to say goodbye to the comfortable faces and familiar halls that have become their second home. Thank you for the memories 
    made, the lessons learnt, and the friendships that were established. Take pride in their achievements and the fortitude 
    they've shown in the face of difficulty. Emotions are running high in the days before graduation as they get ready to 
    start the next phase of their lives. Excitement for the future permeates the air, slightly overshadowed by melancholy 
    for the memories they leave behind. Above all, though, is a deep sense of appreciation for the path we've traveled 
    together and the ties that will always bind us as members of the Class of 2023–2024.</p>
